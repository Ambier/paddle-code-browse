# Browsing Paddle C++ Source Code

By git-cloning this repo and run

```
vagrant up
```

we use [woboq_codebrowser](https://github.com/woboq/woboq_codebrowser)
to convert [Paddle](https://github.com/baidu/paddle) into indexed and
browsable HTML files in `paddle_html` directory.

For more details like why would we like to browse Paddle source code,
please refer to
[this post](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/22484207?refer=cxwangyi) in
Chinese.
